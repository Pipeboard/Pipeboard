## About
Pipeboard is a web dashboard built with [**Node**](https://nodejs.org), [**React**](https://reactjs.org), **JavaScript**, [**PHP**](https://www.php.net/) and **Shell**, that alows an enduser (or users, see reseller info) install, configure and manage lots of - traditionally terminal only - programs and applications in one neat interface without touching the command line.‚Ä†

Behind an idea, there's always a story. - Pipeboard was created initialy as an internal tool for web hosting with no cost (unlike cPanel or Plesk), but after some research, finding that many open source/free softwares didn't really complete the job at hand, or were outdated and not user-friendly/unattractive, so Pipeboard was born from that frustration and in an effort to help other developers.

> <ins><b>FACT!</b></ins> - Pipeboard was named Pipeboard becuase <b>pipe</b>s create things and card<b>board</b> boxes hold things. In this case the pipes enpower the apps and the board would be the app's virtual machines/containers.

## Compatibility
Right now, Pipeboard can only runs on command line based machine with npm, docker and no port-conflicting programs. For non-command-line desktop machines, please check out [Piperunner](https://github.com/Pipeboard/Piperunner) which is a controller desktop app for running Pipeboard in a window.

> <ins><b>TIP!</b></ins> - In the case of desktops with terminal applications; either may be able to be used, with requirements for machines, however it is recommended to use the Piperunner instead as on Macs its harder to navigate the commandline, but it's up to you.
